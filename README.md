# Embedded Projects

This repository contains a growing collection of embedded projects built on the ESP32 platform using the Arduino Framework. While these were built on the ESP32, the code is generally compatible with other microcontrollers that support the Arduino environment, except for features that specifically rely on ESP32-specific hardware capabilities such as Bluetooth. Each project resides in its own folder with code and images.

## Projects

- **Bluetooth Drive**  
  Wirelessly control a robot using the ESP32’s inbuilt Bluetooth interface.

- **Line Following Robot**  
  Follows a track using an IR sensor array and PID control for smooth navigation.

- **MicroMouse**  
  Maze runner employing ultrasonic sensors, IMU, and PID‐based control for precise navigation.

*This collection will expand with new projects over time.*
